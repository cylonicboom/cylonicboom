I mostly make Perfect Dark mods, mostly.

- I'm currently working on a 4-player co / counter-op mod of the Perfect Dark PC port: [Friends of Joanna](https://cylonicboom.itch.io/friends-of-joanna)

- I'm the maintainer of the Mouse Injector for Perfect Dark Decomp. I'll get around to porting it to the Goldeneye decomp, eventually.

- I implemented XBLA-style dual-stick and 1964GEPD-style controls in the PC port
