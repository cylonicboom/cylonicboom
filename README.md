## Catherine Reprobate âœ¨ ðŸ›¸ ðŸ§€

I mostly make Perfect Dark mods, mostly.

- I'm currently working on a 4-player co / counter-op mod of the Perfect Dark PC port: [Friends of Joanna](https://cylonicboom.itch.io/friends-of-joanna). This involves a lot of engine fixes, enhancements, and decomp discoveries (ie more appropriate names for functions and variables) and where appropriate I'm submitting pull requests to the [upstream PC port.](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark) Release Date: When it's done.

- I'm the maintainer of the [1964GEPD Mouse Injector for Perfect Dark Decomp.](https://github.com/cylonicboom/mouse-injector) I'll get around to porting it to the Goldeneye decomp, eventually.

- I implemented XBLA-style dual-stick and 1964GEPD-style keyboard controls (ie reload, alt-fire, crouch modes) in the PC port

## Perfect Dark PC mods:

- No-Pausing, a challenge mod where the menus don't pause the game.
- Moon Jump, a reimplementation of the classic gameshark code
- Gangsta Toggle, a beta feature revival in collaboration w/ @Graslu
- Eyelid Toggle, just for fun

All of my released PC port mods are available in a combined branch: [`coup` (Catherine's Opinionated Unoffical Patches)](https://github.com/cylonicboom/perfect-dark/tree/coup)

Fun fact: I'm terrible at Goldeneye.
