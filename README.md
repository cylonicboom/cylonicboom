I mostly make Perfect Dark mods, mostly.

- I'm currently working on a 4-player co / counter-op mod of the Perfect Dark PC port: [Friends of Joanna](https://cylonicboom.itch.io/friends-of-joanna). This involves a lot of engine fixes, enhancements, and decomp discoveries (ie more appropriate names for functions and variables) and where appropriate I'm submitting pull requests to the [upstream PC port.](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark)

- I'm the maintainer of the Mouse Injector for Perfect Dark Decomp. I'll get around to porting it to the Goldeneye decomp, eventually.

- I implemented XBLA-style dual-stick and 1964GEPD-style keyboard controls (ie reload, alt-fire, crouch modes) in the PC port

Fun fact: I'm terrible at Goldeneye.
